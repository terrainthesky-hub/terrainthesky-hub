Hi! I'm Lesley, welcome to my github!

I'm Data Scientist and Automation Tester that loves data and storytelling. I have a literature degree from UC Berkeley, and I graduated from Lambda School to learn about Data Science and Computer Science. Since then I've learned Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development. I enjoy learning about new tech, doing deep dives into data, developing applications from the ground up, and figuring out challenging puzzles.
